# 🚀 RRP_MCP – SQL Tools & Project Setup

This project contains essential utilities and modules for building an MCP (Model Context Protocol)–based system.  
The goal is to provide clean tools, clear documentation, and a scalable structure for developers.

---

## 📌 What’s Inside

### **1️⃣ `tools/sql_tools.py`**
A helper module that handles:

- SQL schema extraction  
- Query execution  
- NLP-based query generation (future)  
- Utilities for interacting with the database  

This file centralizes all SQL-related logic so the main application remains clean and modular.

---

### **2️⃣ `README.md`**
Provides:

- Full project explanation  
- Setup guide  
- File structure  
- Next steps  
- Contribution guidelines

# 🧰 Using `sql_tools.py`

This module is designed to:

- Load database schema  
- Execute SQL queries  
- Help LLMs understand database structure  
- Provide utilities for future MCP tools  

Example:

```python
from tools.sql_tools import execute_query, get_schema

schema = get_schema()
result = execute_query("SELECT * FROM users")
````

---

# 🚧 Upcoming Features

Planned future additions:

* Full NLP → SQL support
* Auto schema detection using LLM
* Secure environment variable support
* Integration with FastAPI
* Full MCP tool examples
* Database migrations (Alembic)
* Unit tests
